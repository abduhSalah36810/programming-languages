# if statment : 

""" Basiclly we use it to perform opertions
according to spacific conditions we can also 
define multiple statments by (elif and else) """

# how do we write it :
""" if  (condition) (:)
           orders
    if b > a and e > s: 
           print(a)
    elif b < a and e < s :
           print(b)
    else:
           print(wrong)
or all in one line like :
    if b > a and e > s : print(a)     
    elif b < a and e < s : print(b) 
    else : print(wrong) 
or two in one like : 
    print(a) if b > a and e > s  else print (wrong)
or three in one like 
    print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

we can right all that inside itself like :
    if  true :
        if a < b :
            print(b)  """
