# HI HAZ IT GOING ?

""" Object Orianted Programming """

# the story :

"""

like all other great invitions it all started 
with an unsolved problem . the premitive data 
types like int , float , boleen , bytes etc .. 
wasn't convenient or efficient in larg programmms
at all . it just stores a single type of data 
wither str or int .. but if we want to talk
about somthing like cars . we need to define
alot of variables like the color , the brand , 
the fuel capacity and many other stuff . so 
if we wanna deal with that huge amout of data
we need gather all the info of the car in a group . 
and there comes the idea of a struct . it's 
simply like a list in python you can store
int , str , bol , etc in one struct even a struct
in another . but the problem was that structs
can't have functions to describe a certain 
behavior of the entity we are collecting info
about . 
"""

# the great break throw  :
 
"""
so here's comes the great definition of the class 
in short in the car example is abstract consept of
the car without any spacefices . inside the class
we've got objects in which they all inheret their
basic properties like color , shape etc. so to 
sum it up the class is a car the object is a 
BMW or meserati car and each has its own
properties .
