# WAHT'S INHERITANCE ? 

"""
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the
properties from another class. 

"""

# The benefits of inheritance : 

"""
1- It represents real-world relationships well.

2- It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same
code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class
without modifying it.

3- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from
another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically 
inherit from class A. (MULTIPLE INHERITANCE)
